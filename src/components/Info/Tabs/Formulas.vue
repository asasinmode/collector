      <p>Unless it's heavily requested I won't put up the calculation formulas, since making them readable is going to take a lot of time (and most of them aren't pretty looking).</p><br/>
      <p>I verified the damage shown by the site and it seems to be almost <b>100% accurate</b> (in situations where all variables are accounted for), but if you notice something's not right visit the <b>about</b> tab to see where you can contact me.</p><br/>
      <p>To see what stuff I accounted for in calculations visit the <b>disclaimers</b> tab.</p><br/>
